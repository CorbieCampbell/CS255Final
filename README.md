# Final Journal Reflection on DriverPass Project

## _Q: Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?_ ##

### A: The owners of DriverPass, Ian and Liam, requested for a system in which to provide a way for driving students to learn the rules of the road so they could more confidently and successfully pass their DMV tests. They wished to have a web & could based system where customers could make and edit an account with personal info (like name, address, card information), choose a learning package (3 different options) and be able to schedule driving lesson appointments. Additionally, this system could provide the students with up-to-date and current information provided from the DMV, with the ability to take practice tests on the learning resources. The system would have different levels of authorization (simple customer or high level admin), and have a database that would update whenever an appointment change was made or a students driving lesson had new notes from instructors with the ability to print/save these reports for offline use by the admins/owners. Overall, this system sought to help people become more confident and get supervised practice to improve their driving skills to pass tests at the DMV. ###

## _Q: What did you do particularly well?_ ##

### A: I believe my system design document shines the most. I received positive comments on the UML designs, namely how easy each were to follow and with informative non-techincal terms that properly delivered the intended messages about the system and it's necessary functional requirements.###

## _Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_ ##

### A: I believe the system requirements document could use a bit more revision. A deeper dive into specific information like the security for specific 3rd party cloud/web hosting services would help the DriverPass owners to make a more informed decision based on their companies needs and the budget they have. Additionally, the requirements section could be added on to or more detailed, to help give a deeper understanding through less jargon terms for easier readability by technical & non-technicals alike. ###

## _Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_ ##

### A: Considering the user's needs is essential in designing any system, especially one that pertains to an online learning resource. Students need a responsive system, that can give them informative feedback to ensure that what they are learning is both being retained, and also has visible progress. These needs were a top priority when designing the system. Knowing the user's, or target audiences', common needs are met ensures that the system is both running as intended while ensuring that the user can rely upon it to accomplish solutions to problems. In the DriverPass instance, the students could have a system they could rely on to both schedule personal practice for driving, and have an online resource to practice and learn new driving information so that they can pass DMV tests with ease & confidence. ###

## _Q: How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?_ ##

### A: Understanding the vision/problem is a great first step to design a system. Or, in other words, collecting the requirements that the system will accomplish in the end. Knowing the end goal or the intedned final result helps establish the foundation of how the system can be designed to tackle the issue. Knowing the reqwuiremetns can help the creation of the data flow, sequence, action, and object diagrams to be made and re-iterated throught the software development lifecycle to help be the blueprints to develop the system requirements. These are just a few strategies on analyzing and designing a system, but it all stems from first understanding the necessary requirements, and knowing the root problem or end-goal the system is involved in. ###
